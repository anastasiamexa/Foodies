# Foodies
A website that makes recipe searching easy according to your needs.

As part of the course "Web Information Systems", we developed a web application called Foodies.

## Features
- Users can create and log into their account.
- Search for recipes based on some specific filters that the user will choose (e.g. ingredients, cuisine, etc.).
- Save favorite recipes.
- Create daily or weekly meal plans to calculate your calorie intake and cost.
- Get wine recommendation based on your food or find a recommended recipe based on the wine of your choice.

## Tech
For this application we used the Visual Studio environment using ASP.NET technology. The database used is PostgreSQL. In addition,
Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) was used to find the recipes/wines via JSON requests. Finally, we used the Nicepage 
platform for the UI.

## Documentation
The file [Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Foodies/blob/main/Documentation.pdf) contains a detailed description of the methods used to create the application and a user manual (in Greek).
